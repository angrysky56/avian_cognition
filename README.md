# Avian-Inspired Cognitive Architecture

## Convergent Intelligence Framework

A novel cognitive architecture that synthesizes state-space modeling (Mamba-SSM) with extreme quantization (BitNet) through the lens of avian neurobiology, creating a resource-efficient system capable of metacognition, Bayesian inference, planning, and numerical processing.

## Philosophical Foundation

This project explores intelligence as an emergent phenomenon decoupled from its physical substrate. Just as avian cognition evolved independently from mammalian intelligence—achieving comparable functions through radically different neural architectures—this framework demonstrates that sophisticated reasoning can emerge from computational structures fundamentally unlike conventional AI models.

## Core Components

- **Mamba-SSM Backbone**: Linear-time sequence modeling with selective state spaces
- **BitNet Quantization**: 1-bit weight representation for extreme efficiency
- **Metacognition Module**: Calibrated uncertainty estimation and self-monitoring
- **Bayesian Inference Module**: Probabilistic reasoning with belief state tracking
- **Planning/Tool-Use Module**: Multi-step reasoning and action sequence generation
- **Numerical Competence Module**: Precise arithmetic and numerical abstraction

## Implementation Roadmap

The project follows a phased approach to development:

1. **Core Mamba Model Setup**: Establish the backbone model and verify its performance
2. **Cognitive Module Integration**: Incrementally implement the four avian-inspired cognitive modules
3. **BitNet Quantization**: Ensure the entire system operates with 1-bit weight representation
4. **Training & Fine-Tuning**: Develop and apply specialized training protocols
5. **Evaluation & Benchmarking**: Rigorously validate the model's cognitive capabilities

## Training Infrastructure

The repository includes specialized training protocols for each cognitive module:

### Base Training Framework

The `training/base_trainer.py` provides a foundational training orchestrator with:

- Comprehensive experiment tracking with TensorBoard integration
- Checkpoint management for model state preservation
- Configurable training workflows with validation cycles
- Metrics visualization and analysis tools

### Specialized Cognitive Training

Each cognitive module has a dedicated training protocol:

- **Metacognition Training**: Calibrates the model's self-evaluation capabilities through systematic epistemological feedback
- **Bayesian Inference Training**: Shapes the model's belief-updating mechanisms through sequential evidence integration tasks
- **Planning Training**: Develops multi-step reasoning capabilities through structured problem-solving simulations
- **Numerical Training**: Cultivates precise arithmetic operations with extrapolation beyond training range

## Usage Examples

### Metacognition Training
