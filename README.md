# Avian-Inspired Cognitive Architecture

## Convergent Intelligence Framework

A novel cognitive architecture that synthesizes state-space modeling (Mamba-SSM) with extreme quantization (BitNet) through the lens of avian neurobiology, creating a resource-efficient system capable of metacognition, Bayesian inference, planning, and numerical processing.

## Philosophical Foundation

This project explores intelligence as an emergent phenomenon decoupled from its physical substrate. Just as avian cognition evolved independently from mammalian intelligence—achieving comparable functions through radically different neural architectures—this framework demonstrates that sophisticated reasoning can emerge from computational structures fundamentally unlike conventional AI models.

## Core Components

- **Mamba-SSM Backbone**: Linear-time sequence modeling with selective state spaces
- **BitNet Quantization**: 1-bit weight representation for extreme efficiency
- **Metacognition Module**: Calibrated uncertainty estimation and self-monitoring
- **Bayesian Inference Module**: Probabilistic reasoning with belief state tracking
- **Planning/Tool-Use Module**: Multi-step reasoning and action sequence generation
- **Numerical Competence Module**: Precise arithmetic and numerical abstraction

## Implementation Roadmap

The project follows a phased approach to development:

1. **Core Mamba Model Setup**: Establish the backbone model and verify its performance
2. **Cognitive Module Integration**: Incrementally implement the four avian-inspired cognitive modules
3. **BitNet Quantization**: Ensure the entire system operates with 1-bit weight representation
4. **Training & Fine-Tuning**: Develop and apply specialized training protocols
5. **Evaluation & Benchmarking**: Rigorously validate the model's cognitive capabilities
