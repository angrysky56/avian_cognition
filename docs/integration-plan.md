# BitNet Integration Implementation Plan

## Problem Analysis

The current implementation has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The `bitnet_cpp` module is being imported but doesn't exist, causing the fallback implementation to be used
2. The BitNet quantization is not being properly applied to the Mamba model
3. The integration between the existing BitNet repository and the avian cognition project is incomplete

## Proposed Solution

Create a proper integration between the BitNet repository and the avian cognition project following these steps:

### 1. Build a Python Wrapper for BitNet C++ Library

The BitNet repository doesn't have a Python API but is being used through command-line interfaces. We need to create a Python wrapper that can:

- Load BitNet models directly from the C++ implementation
- Quantize PyTorch models to BitNet format
- Provide utility functions for converting models and weights

### 2. Fix the BitNet Integration Module

Update the `bitnet_integration.py` file to:

- Properly import and use the BitNet library
- Use the command-line tools if direct library access is not available
- Provide a suitable fallback implementation

### 3. Implement Proper Model Quantization

Ensure that the model quantization process:

- Uses the correct BitNet quantization approach
- Properly handles the Mamba architecture
- Works with all four cognitive modules

### 4. Add Testing and Validation

Create tests to:

- Verify the quantization process works
- Ensure models can be saved and loaded
- Compare performance with and without quantization

## Implementation Steps

Here's a step-by-step implementation plan:

1. Create a Python binding for BitNet
2. Update the integration code
3. Fix model quantization
4. Test and validate

Let's start with the implementation details:
